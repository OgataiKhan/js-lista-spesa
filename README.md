# Lista della Spesa

This is a simple implementation of a "while" loop in Javascript.

1. Select the ul element in the html and save it as a variable.
2. Save an array with the desired shopping list as a variable.
3. Initialize "i" as a variable outside the loop.
4. Implement the loop as you would with a "for" loop but increment the value of i at the end of each iteration.
